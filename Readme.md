# Computation-based Numerical Analysis in C

Computation-based Numerical Analysis (CNA) is a powerful tool for solving complex mathematical problems. This repository contains a variety of C programs that demonstrate different numerical analysis techniques, including:

- gaussian elimination
- Interpolation
- Numerical Integration
- Linear Algebra Operations
- Matrix Operations
- Eigenvalue Problems

These programs are designed to be educational, providing insights into how numerical methods can be implemented in C.
